# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker
Generates a real time simulation of bus stops between the MIT campus and the Harvard campus, based upon map information from a web server.
## How To Run
Download all files, put in one folder, run real-time-bus-tracker.html on a browser, refresh page and click button to run.
## Future Improvements
I would like to add the functionality for the user to press a button and makes the bus stops appear in the opposite order.
## License Info
Code written by Jaden Richmond using starter code from the MITxPRO full stack development bootcamp course.
